## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM

### What I learned

I learned that you don't need to always put background images with after or before pseudo elements, instead you can just put it in class. Also I learned how to write form. Another thing I am not really sure if you can put color transition on gradients.


### Continued development

I would like to learn to change the color of an svg element on hover. Also I dont really know how to get that "please enter a valid email address" below the email input, so I would like to put that in there. 


### Useful resources

- [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) - Very useful website that generates css gradients.
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2) - Again super useful icons website.
